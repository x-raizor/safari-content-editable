Safari content editable toggler
===============================

![How does it work](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/x-raizor/safari-content-editable/master/demo.gif)

Here is an extension which is quick set and reset Design-mode in Safari browser. It is useful when you want to change something on a page and take screenshot after some changes.
